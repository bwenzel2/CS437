User Story: The user should be able create a quote in the database with a tag associate to it. The user should also be able to search quotes by tag. 

@Test
public void quote_getEmptyTag() {
    Quote q = new Quote();
    assertEquals("", q.getTag());
}

For this first test, this simply test to make sure we can successfully add a quote to our database with a tag. To do this successfully, we needed to modify the quoteserve.java file to accept tags when adding an item. We also needed to modify the Quote Sax Parser to successfully write the new lines to the XML file. 



@Test
public void quote_setTag() {
    Quote q = new Quote();
    q.setTag("round");
    assertEquals("Expected:", "round", q.getTag());
}

For this next test, we need to see if we can search for a tag in a quote. The Quote class needed to be modified to accept tags into them. The Quote Sax handler was changed to find the xml object called "tag" and add the tag to the Quote object. quoteserve.java needed to be modified to prompt the user that they can search for tags in a particular quote. QuoteList needed to be modified to search for a tag in its list of quotes. 


//this adds a quote with a tag to the database, then searches for a quote by that tag and compares the result quote with the one added earlier
@Test
public void add_tag_and_search() {
    Quote newQuote = new Quote("this is a test quote", "test author", "test tag");
    quoteserve qserve = new quoteserve();
    qserve.loadQuotes();
    qserve.addQuote(newQuote.getQuoteText(), newQuote.getAuthor(), newQuote.getTag());
    QuoteList tagSearchResults = qserve.findQuotes(newQuote.getTag(), "tag");
    
    assertTrue( tagSearchResults.getSize() == 1 && quotesAreEqual(tagSearchResults.getQuote(0), newQuote) );
}   

//helper method that returns whether two quotes have identical text, author, and tag fields
boolean quotesAreEqual(Quote q1, Quote q2)
{
    return q1.getQuoteText().equals(q2.getQuoteText()) &&
            q1.getAuthor().equals(q2.getAuthor()) &&
            q1.getTag().equals(q2.getTag());
}
